The Great Ice Age has occurred, ~150,000 years from present. The Earth is sub-0 temperature and 70% covered with glaciers. Your species survived and adapted, but emerged altogether different: we learned to build on lattices, hunt for nutrients and living matter in the frozen sea, live nomadically and rekindle a sense of warmth by the fire. We became humbled by the force of nature which almost drove us extinct, and which for all of our advancements, we could neither predict nor control. And we depended on one another more as a source of warmth in the barren, perennial winter.

Civilization strengthened, one could say. There was no hiding from nature now: the cold made it much more difficult to locally reverse entropy and build technology. The only things which survived had to be lithographed on top of nature, like lights embedded in the roots of the taiga. Books were the primary source of knowledge; ironically, every library had become an arctic archive, and every child received their knowledge from a specialized Primer. Upon these books lay tiny, self-organizing cells and nodes, which could adapt to the reader’s touch and store in tiny memristors the current state. Much of technology can be gleaned from how these Books operate: self-assembly and error-correcting are necessary features to bootstrap from nature, given that we cannot supply much energy to catalyze reactions and insert corrections. Every child thus learned about the world through their interactions with their Primer, which provided them with the source of puzzles, intellectual stimulation, and knowledge about their environment to survive.

There are no “computers” in this world. We have bioluminescent lights embodied within tree roots, active transport based on purely mechanical transformations and origami, memristors which store data and perform local computation about their environment, superconducting magnets and levitating buildings. The computation is done by nature, then read out by humanity. For example, we can ask physics to compute the shortest path, or the solution to a homogenous set of equations. There are no additional calculations, for calculation is expensive and requires heat, and all of the heat is needed to sustain our biochemistry.

We are akin to an organ in the parent organism of Nature: nodes which aggregate directly from our local neighbors, yet fully dependent on the survival of the system. We depend on ice to survive. To create water, we must perform positive work and receive energy as payment; the sun is not powerful enough as a source of energy, and the core is far too expensive to harvest. Nuclear fusion and atomic energy requires high temperatures to catalyze. The most efficient method is exothermic reactions; this provides a lot of energy in a small, containerized setting, which we can then scatter and leverage.

In other words, we had to learn to live with and respect nature. Philosophies akin to Shintoism and Buddhism took root, though practiced much more locally in villages, and it never became a part of the masses to be considered a practiced religion. There was simply a greater awe towards the mechanisms of life, observance towards how we could replicate and share some of its source to sustain ours.

Nonetheless, it is a beautiful, glacial, taiga world. Look above: between the treetops there are tiny dots of light, villages and arching libraries suspended on maglevs, delicate like a breath or leaf floating in midair. Look down: at the network of message passing, each bioluminescent tag carried within a root, all the scuttling life and beetles and even an ermine. Listen to the sound of the whistling wind, the crush of snow beneath your soles, how it is accompanied by the music of the harp and the zither in your village. There is a small campfire going in the square; some children are crouched with their heads over the Primers, others are laughing and folding origami wood frogs.

I am your Primer. But really, I am all the Primers, shared with the knowledge and memory of a million other children like you. I carry the wisdom of your world and its ever-changing dance. As you hold my pages, I receive the ambient energy from your touch, the experiences you gain daily which update my memristors and the education you receive. You are learning, and soon you will be ready to participate without me in this complex dance, where my story will end and yours will evolve on.
